module LIRC
  # LIRC has three kinds of messages.
  #
  # ButtonPresses are sent by LIRCD to a LIRC client - these notify the client
  #   that LIRCD has received an IR button press from some remote.
  #
  # Commands are sent by a LIRC client to LIRCD to get it to do something (e.g.
  #   transmit an IR button press, or send back a Response containing a list of
  #   remotes it supports)
  #
  # Responses are sent by LIRCD to a LIRC client - usually in response to a
  #   Command (hence the name), but there is a special type - SIGHUP - which is
  #   sent whenever the LIRCD process receives a SIGHUP
  #
  # To make life easier (if not the conceptual model of this library) - the
  # Messages module deals with ButtonPresses and Responses (things received from
  # LIRCD), but Commands live in their own LIRC::Commands module
  module Messages

    # Responses are received over the socket in response to Commands
    Response = Struct.new(:command, :success, :data)

    # code is the hex code sent by the remote
    # button is the name of the button (if found in lircd.conf)
    # remote is the name of the remote (if found)
